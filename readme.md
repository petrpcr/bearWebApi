bearWebApi typesript library for nodejs !
====================

UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!! NOT READY FOR USING !!
------------------------------------------------
It should be ready in two months (March 2016).  
This is a simple library inspired  by .NET WebApi.

I created this library because the ones like Express, Koa, Moi are complicated and don't support OOP philosophy.

Inspired by:
* [Rest API](http://www.restapittuorial.com)

You need:
* [node](https://nodejs.org)
